# Minasona Twitch Icons

See cute Minawan not only in the stream but in the chat as well!

This extension displays the Minasona of a Minawan as a badge right next to their username in Twitch chat. It's a neat addon to the chat and helps people get to know everyone's Minasonas better.

Settings:
- Location: Choose to show icons only in Cerber's chat or enable them globally across all of Twitch.
- Defaults: Toggle "standard" Minasonas on or off for those who don't have a custom one yet.
- Size: Use the slider to make the chat icons smaller or larger.
